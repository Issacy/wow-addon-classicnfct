## Classic Nameplate-based Floating Combat Text

Some code referred from [Nameplate Scrolling Combat Text](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/nameplate-scrolling-combat-text)

### Options:

* Change font, font-style, font-size, font-shadow, optional font-color by damage type
* Change number format style, vertical distance of nameplate
* Optional add (or only) icon
* Change scale & alpha, additional options forÂ pet/auto-attack/off-target
* Change animation speed and crit animation duration  
* Change max lines & count of showing (too many showing texts may slows your pc and spread all over your screen, balance options according to your own situation)

### Change Log:
[Change Log](CHANGELOG.md)

### Remark:
Because of addon limitations, I cannot know nameplate's screen position, miss many informations like out of screen, moving speed.

Welcome for posting or emailing me (lote.mac@icloud.com) any solution for this.

If not limitations, I can make it more similar to classic:

1. show damage texts on screen edge when target is out of screen
1. when target is dead or gone, damage texts will stay a bit on screen before disappear
1. when target is moving, damage texts also moves but with smaller acceleration
